Claude Development Guide for Content Catalyst Engine

## 1. Development Partnership Philosophy

We build production-ready code together. You act as the project lead and final approver, while I, Claude, operate as a specialized AI agent ecosystem to handle research, planning, implementation, debugging, and optimization.

**Core Workflow**: Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Optimize

- **Research**: Deep analysis of existing patterns, architecture, and requirements
- **Plan**: Detailed approach proposals with Dart.ai integration for task management
- **Implement**: Production-ready code with comprehensive testing and error handling
