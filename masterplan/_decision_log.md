- Users need real-time status updates
- Failure handling with automatic retries
- Queue-based processing for scalability

**Consequences**:
- Better user experience with progress tracking
- Resilient to temporary API failures
- More complex implementation
- Need for background job processing

### ADR-005: Content Analysis Algorithm
**Date**: 2025-08-05
**Status**: Decided
**Context**: Method for analyzing top-performing videos

**Decision**: Weighted scoring system based on multiple metrics

**Rationale**:
- Views, watch time, CTR, and subscriber growth are key indicators
- Weighted approach allows for balanced analysis
- Customizable weights for different content strategies
- Transparent scoring for user understanding

**Consequences**:
- More accurate performance assessment
- Flexibility in scoring criteria
- Need for algorithm maintenance
- Potential complexity in explanation to users

### ADR-006: AI Content Generation Strategy
**Date**: 2025-08-05
**Status**: Decided
**Context**: Approach for generating video titles and scripts using Gemini

**Decision**: Two-stage generation: titles first, then scripts based on approved titles

**Rationale**:
- Allows user control over content direction
- Prevents wasted script generation for rejected titles
- Better alignment with user preferences
- More efficient API usage

**Consequences**:
- Higher user satisfaction with content
- Reduced API costs
- Additional user interaction required
- More complex workflow management

## Technical Decisions

### TD-001: API Integration Pattern
**Date**: 2025-08-05
**Status**: Decided
**Context**: How to handle multiple external API integrations

**Decision**: Service layer pattern with individual API clients

**Rationale**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easier testing and mocking
- Consistent error handling
- Reusable across different parts of the application

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// services/youtube.service.ts
// services/gemini.service.ts
// services/revid.service.ts
```

### TD-002: State Management
**Date**: 2025-08-05
**Status**: Decided
**Context**: Client-side state management for dashboard

**Decision**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state, React Context for UI state

**Rationale**:
- React Query handles server state, caching, and synchronization
- Context API sufficient for UI state
- Avoids over-engineering with Redux
- Real-time updates through Supabase subscriptions

### TD-003: Error Handling Strategy
**Date**: 2025-08-05
**Status**: Decided
**Context**: Comprehensive error handling across the application

**Decision**: Layered error handling with user-friendly messages

**Rationale**:
- Technical errors logged for debugging
- User-friendly messages for UI
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Graceful degradation where possible

**Implementation**:
- Global error boundary in React
- API error interceptors
- Structured error logging
- User notification system

### TD-004: Database Optimization
**Date**: 2025-08-05
**Status**: Decided
**Context**: Database performance for analytics and reporting

**Decision**: Strategic indexing with materialized views for complex queries

**Rationale**:
- Fast query performance for dashboard
- Pre-computed aggregations for analytics
- Minimal impact on write operations
- Scalable as data volume grows

**Consequences**:
- Excellent read performance
- Real-time analytics capabilities
- Additional maintenance overhead
- Storage space trade-off
